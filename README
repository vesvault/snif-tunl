A modular userspace IP tunnel interface.
Designed to handle local app-to-app SNIF traffic through a VPN interface on
iOS devices, but can be used as a general purpose tunnel.

Network layer: IPv4 (v4.c)
    IPv6 is not currently implemented, can be added as a separate AF module.
    IP fragmentation is not supported, can be added as a separate module.

Transport: TCP (tcp.c), UDP (udp.c)
    TCP retransmission is not implemented, can be added as a separate module.

TCP listening sockets (sock.c, mgr.c):
    Push mode accept using snifl_accept
    Push mode recv
    snifl_send()
    snifl_shutdown()

App proto: DNS over UDP (dns.c)
    Implements a local DNS resolver that always responds with an A record
    pointing to a predefined IPv4 address. Useful in the content of iOS VPN,
    where the system DNS resolver can be directed to the VPN for a particular
    domain name.

Demo:
    A simple HTTP responder over TUN/TAP on Linux.
